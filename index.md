## Your Local Chapter

Hi Ottawa, welcome to your local OWASP chapter\! We are a place to come
and meet local developers and information security professionals, share
ideas, and learn. We try to hold a meeting at least once every two
months in the downtown core. We provide a mix of infosec rockstar talks,
hands on training sessions, and special interest discussion groups. We
are always looking for new ideas for events so let us know if you have
an idea. 

For updates, events, membership; please visit our meetup page: [OWASP Ottawa Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Ottawa/)
