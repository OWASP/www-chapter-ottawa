## Your Local Chapter

Hi Ottawa, welcome to your local OWASP chapter\! We are a place to come
and meet local developers and information security professionals, share
ideas, and learn. 

We try to hold a meeting at least once a month at two different locations in Ottawa.
* Downtown - Shopify (Cody's Cafe, 150 Elgin Street, 6th floor) 
* West End - Trend Micro (40 Hines Rd, 1st Floor)

We provide a mix of infosec rockstar talks,
hands on training sessions, and special interest discussion groups. We
are always looking for new ideas for events so let us know if you have
an idea. You can submit an idea at any point in time at the following link:
[OWASP Ottawa Continuous Call for Speakers](https://sessionize.com/owasp-ottawa-continuous-call-for-speaker/)
