If you are coming into town by car to attend a meetup then you may have questions about parking. Below is a Ottawa University Campus parking map:

Alternatively, you can try your luck on street parking in Sandy Hill or in the Triangle on the other side of the canal (you can cross over using the Corkstown pedestrian bridge).
