* "Sustainable OSINT for Security Professionals" with Micah Clark

### Abstract:
Conducting OSINT is a vital part of any security program, but it's hard for professionals to see past the hype and fancy tools to produce credible, sustainable intelligence. In this talk, Micah Clark, Managing Director of Decision Space, will help you cut through the noise, rethink your approach to finding information, and build systems that keep you focused and curious without getting stuck.
We’ll cover:
- What being an OSINT professional looks like in 2025
- How to balance structure and intuition for better results
- The three key elements of OSINT: Context, Content, and Controls
