### Abstract:
We will discuss problems that are currently solvable by OWASP CycloneDX and its ecosystem (Vers, Purl, TEA) as well as use-cases that either don't have solutions or have inefficient solutions. The talk would include a brief demonstration of OWASP Dependency-Track showing real-world SBOM data from Reliza's open source Rebom project.
