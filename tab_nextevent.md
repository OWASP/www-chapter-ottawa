### Abstracts:
***Title: Finally! Sufficient Logging and Monitoring (MCP Edition) with Robert Babaev***
Observability is a surprisingly important part of security, yet it's often the most neglected. In an age of AI, this can get costly, especially if you don't even know something is going wrong until you get 17,000 support tickets.

We'll go over some relatively painless approaches to getting set up with centralized logging, metrics, tracing, and a rudimentary SIEM. We'll also go over some other potential avenues for achieving better observability, and some tips and tricks for developers.
