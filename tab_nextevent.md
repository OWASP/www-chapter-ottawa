* "E-Waste? In This Economy? Building a testing lab at home on the cheap." with Fennix


### Abstract:

With cloud pricing marching ever higher and the environment becoming an afterthought in the AI boom, being able to learn on the cheap is ever critical. In this presentation we'll demo how to build out a testing lab based on Open Source solutions and old hardware you might have at the bottom of a closet, as well as provide some resources to help make that happen.
