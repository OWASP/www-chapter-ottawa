* "Secure Code Is Critical Infrastructure - Hacking Policy for the Public Good" with Tanya Janca


### Abstracts:
***Title: Secure Code Is Critical Infrastructure - Hacking Policy for the Public Good***
What happens when a security professional tries to help a government fix its insecure software? In this talk, I’ll share my story: from writing a secure coding policy and offering it to the Canadian government, lobbying elected officials, contacting agencies like CRA about their poor security practices—and being met with silence, deflection, or outright dismissal. I didn’t stop there. I wrote public letters, went on podcasts, published on Risky Biz, even got interviewed by CBC. But the institutions in charge of protecting our data? Either silence or “No comment, because security." This isn’t just a rant—it’s a roadmap. I’ll show you the secure coding guideline I created (free to reuse), explain why governments need public-facing AppSec policies, and outline how we can push for secure-by-default practices as citizens, hackers, and builders. Because secure code isn’t just for dev teams—it’s for democracy, privacy, and public safety. Let’s make it law. Let’s make it public.

https://buytickets.at/owaspottawachapter/1888916

We'll explore a handful of vulnerabilities, cover topics such as the workflow of a pentest, creating effective vulnerability reports, and introduce participants to some basic pentest tooling. If you're interested in app exploitation and you want to get hands on with some basics, we'll get you started.

### Presenter:
***Fennix*** After a ten year career in a variety of technical roles, when the opportunity to jump into a pentesting role came up Fennix jumped at the chance. That was nearly a decade ago and in the time since he has several hundred CVEs to his name and numerous strong opinions about the state of the industry. Over that time he created and delivered numerous presentations and training courses for a variety of audiences ranging from security focals and developers to administrative and sales staff to, well, just about anyone. For the past five years he has been part of the core organizing committee and core challenge development team for CyberSci, Canada's post-secondary cybersecurity challenge.
