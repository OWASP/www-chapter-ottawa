### Abstract:
***Title:*** OWASP Ottawa Pentest 101 Workshop: An introduction to Application Pentesting using OWASP Juice-Shop

This is a beginner hands on guided workshop introducing web application penetration testing.

We'll explore a handful of vulnerabilities, cover topics such as the workflow of a pentest, creating effective vulnerability reports, and introduce participants to some basic pentest tooling. If you're interested in app exploitation and you want to get hands on with some basics, we'll get you started.

### Presenter:
***Fennix*** After a ten year career in a variety of technical roles, when the opportunity to jump into a pentesting role came up Fennix jumped at the chance. That was nearly a decade ago and in the time since he has several hundred CVEs to his name and numerous strong opinions about the state of the industry. Over that time he created and delivered numerous presentations and training courses for a variety of audiences ranging from security focals and developers to administrative and sales staff to, well, just about anyone. For the past five years he has been part of the core organizing committee and core challenge development team for CyberSci, Canada's post-secondary cybersecurity challenge.
